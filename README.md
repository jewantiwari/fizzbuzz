# FizzBuzz coding challenge

* Given an array of integers, swap the values based on the given conditions:

- "FizzBuzz" if int is divisible by 3 and 5.
- "Fizz" if int is divisible by 3.
- "Buzz" if int is divisible by 5.
-  int (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
  

* Example 1:
`Input: [1,2,3]
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]`

* Example 2:
`Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

* Example 3:
`Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]`

* You are given a method that that takes a number and returns an array of integers from 1 to the number the passed in. 
* You need to find a way to check each element in the array for the above cases add the needed value to a new String[] for each instance, and then return the String[] with the appropriate values.
